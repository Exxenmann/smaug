# smaug

**EDIT: after learning of owncloud and nextcloud that do exactly what I wanted to do but are already state of the art this project is dead :)**  
  
**I only keep it for code copy reasons for eventual follow up projects.**  


Modest little private cloud for managing your private files.  
Named after Smaug for hoarding data :)

Based on Angular / Laravel.  
(for me hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to four USB sticks)  
  
Planning a web frontend / Android client / Linux, Windows desktop client.  
(but this is probably far future)  
  
For development I use Vagrant.
