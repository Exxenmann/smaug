# smaug
Modest little private cloud for managing your private files.  
Named after Smaug for hoarding data :)

Based on Angular / Laravel.  
(for me hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero W connected to four USB sticks)  
  
Planning a web frontend / Android client / Linux, Windows desktop client.  
(but this is probably far future)  
  
For development I use Vagrant.  
  
Currently its not much more than this:
